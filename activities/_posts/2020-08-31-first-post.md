title: "Cardiff PGR welcome poster competition"
---
To welcome new and returning PGR students to the department, we will be hosting a *virtual* poster presentation, featuring work from current students. Students can vote on their favourite poster, with prizes for the winning student!

This is a great opportunity to meet the current students, get a taste for what research life is like and get involved in postgrad life, so we hope to see you there.

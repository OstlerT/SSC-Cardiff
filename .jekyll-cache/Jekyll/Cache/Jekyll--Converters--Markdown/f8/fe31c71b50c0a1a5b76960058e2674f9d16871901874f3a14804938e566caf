I"U<p>We hope you all are healthy, safe, and doing well.</p>

<p>It seems like we have to continue organizing our fun activities virtually before we can see each other in our beloved university.</p>

<p>How fast can you still do high school mathematics? Are you up for the challenge?
Here is the invitation for the Online Mathematical Pub Quiz :).</p>

<p>Four groups of 4-5 members will be competing against each other. Therefore, we have only 20 positions, which are given on the basis of first come first serve! The quiz is scheduled on <strong>Thursday, 25/06/2020</strong>. Two groups will start at 19.00 and the other two groups will start at 20.00.  Each group will have a skype call with one of the board members.</p>

<p>We give you the choice to make your own team. Please coordinate with each other for making teams. Please fill the following <a href="https://forms.gle/EuQypRNut7yzcHJS6">google form</a> to register. If you do not manage to form a team, thatâ€™s okay, mention it in the form and we will accommodate you in some team.</p>

<p>The winning team will be rewarded once we are back to the office :)</p>

<p>So are you interested in testing your mathematics skills? We are looking forward to meeting you virtually. ðŸ˜Š</p>

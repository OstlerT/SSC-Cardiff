I"T<p>With the new term, we will be bringing back Wednesday PGR talks! These talks are given by PhD students, to PhD students, about anything mathematically motivated. This can be something to do with your research, or just something interesting you’d like to share with the PGR community. Previous talks have varied from introductions to a research field, specific topics from recent student published works, to the science of star wars and the mathematics of story telling. We have also received talks from outside of the mathematics department, which is a great opportunity to get some constructive feedback on mathematical ideas you’re using in your work from some friendly postgrad students.</p>

<p>PGR talks are given every two weeks on a Wednesday at 2pm, followed by ‘Tea at 3’ where we gather informally for a chat over some tea, coffee, biscuits and cake.</p>

<p>As we can’t meet in person, the SIAM community will pay to have biscuits sent to you if you give a talk!</p>

<p>If you would  like to give a talk, please email <a href="WilliamsEM20@cardiff.ac.uk">Elizabeth Williams</a>.</p>

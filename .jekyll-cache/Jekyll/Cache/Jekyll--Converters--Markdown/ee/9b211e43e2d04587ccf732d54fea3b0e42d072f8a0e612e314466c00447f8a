I")<p>Hi everyone!</p>

<p>We have our first Women in Mathematics (WiM) event of the academic  year planned – a talk by our own wonderful Maggie Chen on Tuesday October 27th 1-2pm. She will speak about her research, as well as her experiences as a female mathematics researcher.</p>

<p>This event is <strong>open for everyone to attend</strong> and I hope to see lots of you there!</p>

<p>This will be the first of a new seminar series WiM has set up in collaboration with the Piscopia Initiative called PiWORKS – Piscopia Women and Other Researchers Keynote Seminars. It will be a monthly seminar highlighting female and non-binary researchers in mathematics, with the research discussed aimed to be accessible for undergrads.</p>

<p>Please find the Zoom details below. Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>

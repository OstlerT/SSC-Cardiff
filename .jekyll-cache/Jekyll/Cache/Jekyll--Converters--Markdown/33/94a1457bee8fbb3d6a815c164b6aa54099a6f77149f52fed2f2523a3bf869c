I"ù<p>The members of our group first met as mathematics PhD students at Cardiff University, sharing a common supervisor. We worked together during the 2020 â€˜Recoveryâ€™ Covid-19 National Ecological Research Council hackathon, during which we decided to work on modelling the effect of lockdown measures and, particularly, social distancing, in order to investigate the effect this could have on the environment. Our work was awarded 1st prize, and can be found <a href="https://github.com/Lucyhenley/CardiffMATHBIO_NERCHackathonTwo_PublicTransport">here</a>.</p>

<p>Following our success, we realised that maximising capacity under social distancing would grow to become an important issue as the world exits lockdown. So, we continued developing our methods and improving on the app, so that it could be applied to more general situations.</p>

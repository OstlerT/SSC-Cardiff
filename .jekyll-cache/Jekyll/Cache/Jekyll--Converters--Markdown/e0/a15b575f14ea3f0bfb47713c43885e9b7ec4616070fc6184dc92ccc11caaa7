I"z<p>To welcome new and returning PGR students to the department, we will be hosting a <em>virtual</em> poster presentation on October 7th, featuring work from current students. Students can vote on their favourite poster, with prizes for the top three posters! The session will run from 11:00-12:15, and will be followed by virtual tea.</p>

<p>If you wish to submit a poster, please email us with your poster title, and a brief abstract, by 28th September.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity to meet the current students, get a taste for what research life is like and get involved in postgrad life, so we hope to see you there.</p>

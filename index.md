# Organise your office space to maximise the number of occupied desks, without breaking social distancing.

Social distancing in a post-Covid era means that closed spaces that are densely packed with people are a thing of the past, but few businesses or institutes can support the same number of people whilst still following current government guidelines. Every empty restaurant table, every vacant seat on a train and every unoccupied desk in an office represents diminished productivity and reduced profits. Making the most of the space available is key to rescuing productivity in the face of crisis, and Safe Seating Solutions helps to make sure you structure your facilities in the best way possible.

## How our algorithm works

Seating arrangement problems like this one are incredibly complicated, and whilst finding a safe seating arrangement is possible, its very difficult to find the best one possible. Our algorithm presents a rapid solution by trying out random seating arrangements and removing seats that would be unsafe to use as it goes. We can try a huge number of combinations, selected intelligently, in a short space of time, so we can keep improving on the solutions found much faster than any human.
